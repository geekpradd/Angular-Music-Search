##Music Search: A Music Info App built on Angular JS

This is a AngularJS app that I created after learning to make http requests (using `$http`) in AngularJS. It uses the TinySong API to get Song Info and displays it. Pretty simple but still nice.

###Some API Tweaks

In the JS Code, you can see that in place of TinySong, I have my pydictionary API. The reason for this is that the TinySong API does not have CORS enabled and to circumvent that I had to use Flask which is hosted on the PyDictionary API URL.
